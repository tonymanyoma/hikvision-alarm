/**
 * System Log Data Update
 *
 * As the control log is written, the same information is
 *  sent out the RS-232 port. The log information will have
 * the ddd index value set to “000” to indicate a logging
 * entry.
 *
 * The log data may also be requested with the “ld”
 * (lower case “LD”) command below. Modified in M1 version 4.3.2
 *
 * The “System Log Data Update” transmission option, transmits the
 * updated status whenever it changes and is enabled by setting the
 * location TRUE in the M1 Control Global Programming Locations 35.
 * Example: “Xmit Event Log–ASCII” (Yes or No). The request for log
 * data “ld” is not controlled by this option.
 *
 * @see 4.23 System Log Data Update (LD)
